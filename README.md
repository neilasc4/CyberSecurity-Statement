# Cornelius Mantle – Cybersecurity Professional

Hi, I'm Cornelius Mantle, born and raised in Hartsdale, New York, where my passion for computers began at an early age. Since the age of five, I’ve been known as a “computer whiz,” and that early interest has grown into a focused commitment to protecting systems, organizations, and individuals through the field of cybersecurity.

I’m currently enhancing my skills in programming and attention to detail, both essential for identifying and mitigating cyber threats. One of my strongest qualities is that I am highly trainable and dedicated. I quickly adapt to new technologies and thrive in learning environments.

I’m guided by two core values: defending critical infrastructure and protecting user privacy. Having personally experienced identity theft, I understand the serious consequences of cybercrime, and I’m deeply motivated to help prevent similar harm, especially within vulnerable communities.

My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the cybersecurity mission of any organization I work with. I bring not only developing technical skills but also a genuine sense of purpose to the field.
